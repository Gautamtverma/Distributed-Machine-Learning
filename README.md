# Data Science and Engineering with Apache Spark

This deposit is about all assignments I've finished for online courses about how to perform data science and data engineering at scale using Spark.
Every assignment requires python coding fluency and deep understanding for Spark framework and scalable algorithml. Besides, Familiarity with basic machine learning concepts and exposure to algorithms, probability, linear algebra and calculus is a must to complete all those assignments.

> Part 1: Basic notebook usage and Python integration

> Part 2: An introduction to using Apache Spark with the PySpark SQL API running in a notebook

> Part 3: Using DataFrames and chaining together transformations and actions

> Part 4: Python Lambda functions and User Defined Functions

> Part 5: Additional DataFrame actions

> Part 6: Additional DataFrame transformations

> Part 7: Caching DataFrames and storage options

> Part 8: Debugging Spark applications and lazy evaluation

lab two:
> Part 1: Introduction and Imports

> Part 2: Exploratory Data Analysis
